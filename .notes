Added pagination to getUser, using limit and offset in findAll.
//Data Consistency: In updateUser, after updating the user, it might be more accurate to return the updated user data fetched from the database instead of relying on potentially stale data.


UPDATE employees
SET isAdmin = 'true'
WHERE eid = 1;

DELETE FROM employees WHERE `employees`.`eid` = 2

Consider adding pagination details (like total count) in the getUser method response for better client-side handling.
